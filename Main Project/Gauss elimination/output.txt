Initial Augmented Matrix:
         2         1        -1         8
        -3        -1         2       -11
        -2         1         2        -3

====== Forward Elimination (Gaussian Elimination) ======

Matrix after step 1:
         2         1        -1         8
         0       0.5       0.5         1
         0         2         1         5

Matrix after step 2:
         2         1        -1         8
         0       0.5       0.5         1
         0         0        -1         1

Matrix after step 3:
         2         1        -1         8
         0       0.5       0.5         1
         0         0        -1         1

====== Final Solution ======
x1 = 2
x2 = 3
x3 = -1
